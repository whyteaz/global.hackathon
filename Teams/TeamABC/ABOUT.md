Project
=======
Theme no.3<br><br>

We believe that the single most important reason why people don't read TOS, EULA, and other legal stuff is simply because
we are <strong>LAZY</strong>. That's human nature.<br> 
However, parts of the responsibility is from the publisher themself. Therefore, in order to improve the situation we need to make changes at both user and publisher side.<br><br>
Our solution is,<br> 
1. Provide a template and guideline for publisher to write down brief key summary of each clause of their legal document with no/minimal technical jargon.<br>
2. A mandatory video that display those key summary with narrator and countdown timer. We aim to have maximum of 45 seconds per type of legal document. 
<br><br>
We do encourage publisher to reward their users after they done viewing/listening to the video. For example, upon registration, Dropbox user can get free 50Mb extra storage after completed the video.<br>
We do believe that by implementing these approach, we could encourage more than 80% of users to reading those sumarize clause.<br>
