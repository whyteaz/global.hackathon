About the Team
===========================

We are the Zoonies! We're a group of burners & technology lovers from San Francisco and Utah!

TL;DR: Thomas, Patrick, and Ray (maybe?) work in some sort of job where they have stand-up meetings on a daily basis.  Pam is spending some time with electric cars and Margeaux, source of inspiration, light and joy, is our resident aesthician, product instigator, scrummaster and wordsmith.
 

Skills and Plans
=======
As a combined team, we use these languages on the daily:
- Javascript
- Java
- Python
- Ruby on Rails

APIs that we are like include but are not limited to:
- Twitter
- Google Predictions
- Google Geocoding
- Google Freebase

Leaning toward theme #1, we're tossing around ideas of integrating environment, suprise data types, and biometrics data over time.  Looking to generate a web-kit app that can pull in data from a backend service with configurable data-feeds.
